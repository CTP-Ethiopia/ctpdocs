CTP aims to demystify the college application process to US universities by giving Ethiopian high school students the necessary training they will need to excel on the SAT exam and by offering comprehensive help with filling out the different aspects of the college application. Furthermore, CTP has a new internship platform called CTP Careers, aimed at providing a database of varied sought out companies, organizations, and start-ups that high-school students to recent college graduates can apply to and gain professional experience.
