About
-------

.. Not really a documentation considering the fact that we are not creating any new apps or anything, but it felt only correct to use Github to host our ReadtheDocs


| This is a simple documentation page designed for hosting guides on the summer session programs at `CTP Ethiopia. <https://ctpethiopia.org/>`_ 

| We will be updating files and adding pages as we incorporate more software and add customizations
| As sessions start, we will also be adding guides on  Authentication, assignment submissions methods and other necessary activities for students and instructors.
