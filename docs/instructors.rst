Instructor myCTP App Guide
============

| For instructors, we are setting up a separate Course as a guide to managing courses.
|
| If you are an **instructor**, take a look at the following `course <https://my.ctpethiopia.org/app/v1/course/view.php?id=5>`_ to learn more about managing classes and students in your class.
|
| Access to the `course <https://my.ctpethiopia.org/app/v1/course/view.php?id=5>`_ requires `authentication <https://docs.ctpethiopia.org/en/latest/authentication.html>`_ and special access. If you don't yet have an account yet or have no access to the course, you can request help by creating a `support ticket <https://tech.ctpethiopia.org/support/index.php?a=add>`_ with a **high** priority. If you also happen to be a board member, please check the `trello <https://trello.com/ctp147/>`_ for weekly updates and tasks to be completed.
